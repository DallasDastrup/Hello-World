# Hello-World
Intro to GitHub - learning, generating ideas, and saving good code

Hello beautiful creatures 👋

My name is Dallas and I am starting my self-taught coding journey. Expecting to make a lot of mistakes, suffer through headaches, but become better for it. Things I love: Shredding 🏂, traveling ✈️, working out 🏋️, wrestling 🤼, trying my hand at everything 🤌, enchiladas 🫔, stealthy ass jaguars 🐆, and getting weird 🍄. Please feel free to message me about any of these topics. Things I hate: olives 🫒 - that is all, just olives. If I could eradicate all olive trees I would. Anywho, I hope to join the supportive programming community to learn from those more experienced than myself. I want to create something wonderful that makes people's lives easier and gets them in touch with their environment. Ideally, putting me in a position to have more freedomso I may do more of the things I love.

Let's GO!!
